with name contains cmd - py.test -k CreditCard -v -s


# -k stands for method names execution, -s logs in output -v stands for info metadata
# run those testcases which are identifies as smoke we can do this bcz in pytest there is a concept
of mark with that you can mark that test case name
@pytest.mark.smoke
def test_firstProgram():

# how to skip some testcases bcz u know there are some bugs
# i want to run all testcases but not want run 1. 

# if u want to run a testcase but don't want to seein the report that it has passed or fail then use
