Instead of defining the test_fixture  in every file we can use the conftest file

Fixtures are used as setup and tear down methods for the test cases - conftest file to genera the Fixtures and 
make it present at all test cases



Fixtures also help to load the data.

if you find that a particular fixture is requiredin many file then only use conftest otherwise keeping 
fixture at same file is ok.
